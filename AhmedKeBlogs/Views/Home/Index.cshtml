                    <h3>Re-designing Slack on Mobile</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like the world around us, Slack has grown and changed
                        significantly over the last decade. What started out as a simple
                        chat tool is now a multi-modal product that allows for more
                        meaningful collaboration with features like voice clips, video
                        clips, huddles, canvases, lists, Slack Connect, Sales Elevate, and
                        so much more. But with our mobile app’s previous design,
                        accommodating these features without overshadowing the essence of
                        organization and collaboration felt like a tight squeeze. We didn’t
                        want Slack’s expanding capabilities that cater to diverse
                        organizational needs to turn the app into a cluttered space for our
                        users. It was time to rethink the mobile information architecture.

                    <h3>Buy a shoes</h3>
                    <p>
                        No two feet are alike. And, no, we are not talking here about
                        different people with different foot lengths and widths. Even when
                        it comes to the same person, there are often small differences
                        between their feet. In fact, about 60% of the population has
                        different sized feet, according to one study. Most people have one
                        foot that's both larger and wider than the other and need to wear
                        different shoe sizes for each foot. Unfortunately, most of us opt
                        for one shoe size or the other and purchase footwear that doesn't
                        fit properly. In this article, we'll tell you how to buy shoes if
                        your feet are different sizes and how the incorrect size can affect
                        your health.

                    <h3>Pakistan's ODI series against West Indies</h3>
                    <p>
                        The vice-captain, Shadab Khan, may have been taking 'flying' lessons
                        for the kind of catches he is committed to in the field. The
                        one-handed flying catch by the Superman Shadab surely provided
                        Pakistan a breakthrough, but that’s not even important to the fans.
                        Cricket enthusiasts were just in awe of 'that' catch itself. They
                        are not wrong, though. Flying catches like those are not everyone’s
                        cup of tea unless you’re Shadab Khan and you know how to fly.

                <p>
                    A smartphone (often simply called a phone) is a mobile device that
                    combines the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with
                    advanced computing capabilities. It typically has a touchscreen
                    interface, allowing users to access a wide range of applications and
                    services, such as web browsing, email, and social media, as well as
                    multimedia playback and streaming. Smartphones have built-in
                    cameras, GPS navigation, and support for various communication
                    methods, including voice calls, text messaging, and internet-based
                    messaging apps.

                <p>
                    A personal computer (PC) is a microcomputer designed for use by one
                    person at a time. Prior to the PC, computers were designed for --
                    and only affordable for -- companies that attached terminals for
                    multiple users to a single large mainframe computer whose resources
                    were shared among all users. By the 1980s, technological advances
                    made it feasible to build a small computer that an individual could
                    own and use as a word processor and for other computing functions.

                <h3>Cricket</h3>
                <p>
                    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of
                    eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
                    (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                    bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team
                    (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding
                    bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling
                    the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the
                    pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and
                    then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team
                    scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the
                    ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball
                    is bowled illegally.
